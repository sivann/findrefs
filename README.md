A collection of visual basic word macros I wrote which do the following:

* FindUnrefedTablFigures: find uncited/unreferenced tables and figures
* FindUncitedRefs: find uncited/unreferenced references (citations)
* SortRefsByOrderofAppearance: sort references in citation order (order of appearance in text). Backup first for this one.
other vb macros

Usefull when writing journal/conference papers. I know I should have stayed with LaTeX which does all this automatically. Table and figure numbers must be entered as captions, and in-text references to them with the "insert->crossreference" menu option.

I Used those circa 2000 for some journal papers.
